🚀 Project Summary: Safety Check API with Gemini AI
🔹 What We Built:
We created a Safety Check API that allows users to:
✅ Enter a location and get nearby police stations & hospitals 🚔🏥
✅ Check the distance from the main road for accessibility 🚗
✅ Ask safety-related questions using Google Gemini AI 🤖

🔹 How It Works:
1️⃣ User enters a location (e.g., "Koregaon Park, Pune")
2️⃣ The API fetches real-time data from Google Maps & Roads API
3️⃣ It returns safety info (police stations, hospitals, road distance)
4️⃣ Gemini AI generates a natural-language answer combining real data

🔹 Key Technologies Used:
🟢 Flask → Handles API requests
🟢 Google Maps API → Fetches safety-related data
🟢 Google Gemini AI → Generates human-like responses
🟢 Docker → Containerized for easy deployment
